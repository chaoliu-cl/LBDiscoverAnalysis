# LBDiscoverAnalysis

`LBDiscoverAnalysis` contains the analysis-facing components of the original
`LBDiscover` workflow.

## Scope

This package focuses on:

1. Co-occurrence analysis
2. Discovery models (ABC, AnC, LSI, BITOLA-style)
3. Validation and evidence checking
4. Visualization and reporting

`LBDiscoverAnalysis` depends on `LBDiscover` for article retrieval,
preprocessing, dictionary lookup, and entity extraction.
